In the heart of campus, I dream and I thrive,
With innovation and passion, I’m ready to dive.
I’ve got ideas to spark, and visions to share,
With Google as my guide, I’ll take you there!

From coding hacks to organizing cool events,
I’ll spread the word with zero pretense.
I’ve even won a hackathon prize, third place in line,
Google Developers pushed me to innovate and shine!

Through workshops, apps, and tutorials galore,
I’ll help my peers open every door.
A Google Student Ambassador, that’s the dream,
Building bridges with tech, like a seamless team!
